Support for FOC Marathon Contest 

The MH.EXE program runs cooperatively with N1MM+ logger to track QSO's made and needed during the FOC Marathon contest.  
MH connects to an RBN node, filters those FOC call signs of interest and sends them to N1MM+.  N1MM+ sends logged QSO's to MH.

MH displays two classes of dynbamically updated windows  One class shows the colorized list of all stations with whom you have
worked on a specific number of bands.  For example, all your "fivers" are shown in one window.  You see what frequency
each needed station is spotted on so you can quickly and efficiently ask them to fill in the needed band for your coveted sizer.
Similarly, all stations with whom you have four bands logged are displayed in their own window.  And same for three, two and one banders, althogh they 
not as useful as your fives and fours.

The second class of window shows the colorized list of stations being spotted on a particular band.  There is one window for each of the six bands.
It is just an alternative way of helping you fill in the needed bands.

If you want to see a particular window, you mouse click (or press) the botton on the display.

As the Marathon progresses, MH helps the operator stay a little bit sharper a little bit longer!
